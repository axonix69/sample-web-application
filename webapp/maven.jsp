<p>Maven, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven" class="externalLink">Yiddish word</a> meaning
<em>accumulator of knowledge</em>, began as an attempt to
simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project. There were
several projects, each with their own Ant build files, that were all
slightly different. JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard
way to build the projects, a clear definition of what the project
consisted of, an easy way to publish project information, and a way to
share JARs or WARs across several projects.</p>
<p>The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any
Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will
make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help
with the comprehension of any Java-based project.</p>
